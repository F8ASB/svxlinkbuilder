We are now about to configure SVXLink to the specifications provided. 
They will replace those held in the SVXLink default configuration. 
To change them in the future, you can do so in the Web Dashboard. 
The first change will be to the USB soundcard in use. 
Then further changes will be to the SVXLink configuration. 
At the end of the configuration, you can access the Web Dashboard. 
The fixed IP address will be provided shortly.
