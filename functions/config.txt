We are now about to configure SVXLink to the specifications provided. 
They will be exchanged with those held in the SVXLink default configuration. 
If you need to change them in the future, you can do so in the Web Dashboard. 
The first change will be the sound configuration withthe USB soundcard in use. 
Then changes will be to the SVXLink configuration, which is a bit more involved. 
At the end of the configuration, you will be able to access the Web Dashboard.
