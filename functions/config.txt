We are now about to configure SVXLink to your Specifications that you have made already. 
They will be exchanged with those held in the SVXLink default configuration. 
If you need to change them in the future, you will be able to do so in the Web Dashboard. 
The first change will be to the sound configuration, selecting the USB soundcard in use. 
The subsequent changes will be to the SVXLink configuration, which is a bit more involved. 
At the end of the configuration, you will be able to access the Web Dashboard. 
The fixed IP address will be provided shortly.
